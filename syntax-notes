== Syntax ==

Blocks start with ":" and end with ".".  "_" or "â€¦" followed by an identifier is equivalent to a string of "."s.  Within a block, newlines or commas separate statements.

A table is comma-separated values surrounded by parentheses.

A closure/function is a table followed by a block.

(OPS seems not to be used.  There are odd "query", "path", "querypath", and "message" tokens.  But "message" seems to include identifiers.)


== Object Model ==

Vtables ("Mixins") respond to "lookup", "allocate", "def", and "delegated".  "def" can take either a closure or a literal.  (Or a "proto", aka "Compiled", but I don't know what that is.  A bytecoded method?  Yeah, looks like.)  "delegated" returns a new vtable which is a subclass of the receiver.

"Object", etc are all vtables.  A list: Lobby, Mixin, Object, Number, NilKind, Boolean, String, Tuple, Closure, Potion, Source, Bytes, Compiled, Ref.  (These are all defined in Lobby.)

Lobby is the root of the class tree, above even Object.  Vtable ("Mixin") and Object are its two subclasses.
