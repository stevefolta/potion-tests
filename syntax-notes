Blocks start with ":" and end with ".".  "_" or "â€¦" followed by an identifier is equivalent to a string of "."s.

A table is comma-separated values surrounded by parentheses.

A closure/function is a table followed by a block.

OPS seems not to be used.  There are odd "query", "path", "querypath", and "message" tokens.  But "message" seems to include identifiers.
